# In vanilla there is a file named x_tank_chassis.txt. It seems to have something to do with "duplicating" variants or something like that. I think it's for people that don't have NSB
# Edit: I figured it out; it turns a medium tank chassis with a flamethrower "gun" into a medium_tank_flame_chassis, which is what all the modifiers of stuff is being applied to.
